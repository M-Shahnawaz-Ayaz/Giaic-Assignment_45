// Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of arguments each time.

function sandwich (...item:string[]){
console.log("your sandwich order : ")

for(let items of item){
    console.log(items,"with free soft drink");
}
}

console.log("\nEnjoy your sandwich Mr shah and give us rate\n")

 sandwich("\nbeef_sandwich","chicken_sandwich","classic BLT\n")
sandwich("\nTurkey Avocado","Veggie Garden","classic BLT\n")
sandwich("\nTikka mali","BBQ_sandwich","Ham and swiss\n")



// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

           function car_info(manufacturer, model, ...options) {
        let car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model
    };

    
        for (let i = 0; i < options.length; i += 2) {
        let key = options[i];
        let value = options[i + 1];
        car[key] = value;
    }

    return car;
}


        let my_car = car_info("Toyota", "Corolla", "color", "blue", "year", 2020);
         console.log(my_car);
